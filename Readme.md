This capstone project is a mock up of an app that I am creating. 

WasteTracker

Wastetracker is a centralized hub for collecting and disseminating information about which companies and regions produce the most plastic, and helps you to contact those companies to put pressure on them to commit to stricter targets.

The app can be used to read information about plastic production numbers by different companies and regions, to submit new data about their practices and ability to meet targets, and to generate letters and petitions directed at those institutions.
