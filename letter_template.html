    <h3>Here is a template to draft a letter to a company or local government administration. </h3>
    <body>
Dear {{}},

It has come to the attention of local residents of {{}}
that the amount of virgin plastic being produced by {{}} is not only significant, but it also exceeds the limits afforded to you.

We also note that {{ }} pledged as recently as {{}} to reduce the amount of new plastic produced, and also capture and reuse/recycle {{}}% of this number.

We would like to remind you that there is continued evidence that these targets are not being met.

Copies of this letter, and corroborating evidence, are being sent to the following news organizations: {{}}, and to the following social media accounts: {{}}.

We, and they, will continue to put public pressure on you and {{}} to bring these numbers back in line with your pledges, and to encourage you to reduce, or eliminate, virgin plastic production completely.

Yours sincerely, 

The WasteTrackers
